# Machine Learning Foundations

This repository contains a collection of machine learning algorithm implementations written in MATLAB. It was developed as part of the *"Machine Learning"* course at the University of Zaragoza, and aims to deepen understanding of key ML concepts and their mathematical underpinnings.

## Overview
The repository is organized into folders by algorithm. Each folder includes:
- Source code
- A detailed report describing the implementation, methodology, and experimental results
> **Note:** All reports and code are written in Spanish

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**
- **Regularization Techniques**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Multiclass Logistic Regression**
- **Naive Bayes Classification**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Recommendation Systems**


## Educational Context
This project was completed as part of coursework at the University of Zaragoza. It is intended for educational purposes, providing hands-on experience with both the implementation and analysis of foundational machine learning techniques.
